            <p>Mr.Happy, a 66-year-old man, heavy smoker, having hypertension and DM under medications, was diagnosed as
                          having adenocarcinoma of right lower lung, with metastasis of brain, thyroid and multiple lymph nodes. He
                          was going through chemotherapy, radiotherapy since July of 2018.</p>
                        <p>I remembered Mr. Happy quite well. I first met him in December of 2018, he came to our ward because of
                          pneumonia and was under antibiotic treatments. He was this guy not so tall, with a bit of grey hair, the
                          rough touch of his hands and mud stuck in his fingernails showed himself as a farmer. He was this cheerful
                          old man, I remembered the first time I took care of him, he was first laughing at my not-so-fluent
                          Taiwanese, but still tried to communicate with me. In the end we both laughed about my awful Taiwanese. He
                          had a beloved wife who took care of him through every time of his admission. Mr. Happy always likes to put
                          his legs on the accompany chair where his wife sleeps, while himself sleeping on his manual bed. </p>

            <p>Around two weeks later he was discharged. But in late January of 2019, he was admitted again, for this
                          time he suffered from legs cellulitis and underwent another episode of antibiotic treatment. He came back
                          again to our hospital in late February. It had been three times in three months. This time he was admitted
                          for fever with progressive productive cough, dyspnea and anorexia. He was still this happy guy who would
                          laugh about my poor Taiwanese, and appreciate my jokes. But he generally looked much weaker and tired. His
                          condition was worse compared to previous times complicated with irregular heartbeat. A CT(computerized
                          tomography) scan was performed, and showed that his lung cancer is in progression, there was even a the
                          lesion in his right lung suspected to be necrosis or abscess. Which implied he had a very serious
                          infection problem inside his lung, and the poor prognosis of his disease. </p>
                        <p>Doctor explained to Mr. Happy and his family for his grave disease. Mr. Happy signed his DNR himself, he
                          wanted no resuscitation in the end of his life and started to write his will. He knew that there was not
                          much time for him. He also wished to be able to go back home and back to his field to see all his crops
                          again. His wife on the other hand, look much more anxious about the issue of Mr. Happy's condition. Doctor
                          suggested that Mr. Happy transfer to another hospital in Yunlin and receive palliative care there. In this
                          way he don't have to endure a long 3 hour ride from his home in Yunlin to Taipei to seek medical help and
                          would be able to stay around his home. However, his daughters asked Dr. Chiu the possibility to try
                          immunotherapy first, they didn't want to give up before even trying. She said that if its possible to give
                          him a month or two extra days to live, they are willing to pay the money at all cost. Mr. Happy didn't
                          show much reluctant to his daughters decision, but also doesn't seem sure about doing it. He was
                          discharged in early March waiting for the application of immunotherapy to be permitted. </p>
                        <p>The last time I saw him in the ward was his visit to receive the immunotherapy drugs. Later on in May I
                          overheard that Mr. Happy had passed away. </p>
                        <p>I have been asking the question myself, for what reason does some caregivers would wish to extend the
                          patients lives if they see them suffering from pain and the irreversible truth that the disease is leading
                          them to die? Is it out of love? Is it guilt that they wanted to spend more time with the patients because
                          they could have but didn't? Or is it the pressure from Chinese family culture that other relatives or
                          other elders would judge that you didn't do your best to take care of your parents? (I remembered this
                          scene, just happened yesterday, a lung cancer lady, super skinny and weak, she had three daughters and one
                          son. Some relatives came to visit her in the hospital. Before they left, they padded on her son's shoulder
                          and told him, they expected him to do his best to take care of his mom. I felt the huge burden on him at
                          that moment.)</p>
                        <p>I also thought about why at the moment when decisions were made, there wasn't a better discussion with
                          Mr. Happy, his wife and his daughter about his own will, how doctors, nurse practitioners, social workers,
                          us nurses weren't able to dive into the deeper part of everyone's mind and try to make them speak for
                          themselves and talk about the future plan they wish? And then another thing came into my mind, is it even
                          important to take caregivers decision into words? Why wasn't the patients own will put into priority? Why
                          do people even wanted to make decisions for another person?</p>
                        <p>I guess I can only conclude, when speaking about life and death decisions, its always very complicated,
                          But i would want to make my own decision and I wish other people can respect me.</p>
