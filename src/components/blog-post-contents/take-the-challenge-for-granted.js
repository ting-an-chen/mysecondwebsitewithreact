            <p>I believe in each stage of life there is a challenge and a goal in front of us. When we are young, the
                          challenge is to build up the knowledge we need to live independently, we search for who we are and who we
                          want to become. When we get older, we are able to find a profession we like, we have a quite stable and
                          decent income, and then we look for other stuffs in life. Setting higher goals like devote ourselves into
                          making the world better, or want to be more influential. Some people build up their own families; have
                          kids from this period of time. Then the challenge now would be how to bring the kids up. Next, we enter
                          the stage of becoming the elders, we no longer worry about kids, or money. The upcoming challenges comes
                          from the body getting pretty rusty, needs to go to the doctors to fix some overly used ankles, and we all
                          destined that day that the body is not function well anymore and we face death. </p>

            <p>However, for some people, before they can even complete goals from each stage of life to reach becoming
                          old enough, they already faces the problem of being diagnose of cancer when they are still in their
                          30s-40s. There is this dilemma of whether to go through the cancer treatment in wish they can kill the bad
                          cells in the body and live longer, or to continue of their goal: bring up the kids, building up
                          career.....</p>
                        <p>Cancer treatment is a long-term fight. Completing the whole section of chemotherapy requires going to the
                          hospital every week, spending hours even days there. With further follow up checks, other complications
                          cause by the treatments like fever, diarrhea. You need to be strong enough to go through it.</p>
                        <p>I remembered one 42-year- old-man; he was diagnosed of Stomach cancer. The cancer cell had already spread
                          through his lower abdomen and causing bowel obstruction, making him feel nausea. He was given nutrition
                          support through the blood, instead from the mouth. During his stay, he asked the doctor for permission to
                          take his daughter out for movie, because she wanted to watch “The detective Pikachu” on her birthday. The
                          simplest thing of taking your kid out on their birthday became so much difficult, when you are currently
                          under treatments, and when your health condition doesn’t even allowed doing so.</p>
                        <p>There was another 36-year-old man, he had last stage rectal cancer. He was admitted because his newly
                          developed brain metastasis was causing him seizure. He had a 7 year old son and a 4 year old daughter. One
                          Saturday, he told me that his kids and parents will be visiting him, and hurried me up to finish my
                          morning treatment with the drugs. He said he didn’t want his kids to see him with all the lines. I asked
                          if he told his kids he is sick. He told me he and his wife had been trying to explain to them gradually,
                          and the kids also sensed that their dad was spending more and more time in the hospital, they got more
                          anxious about it.</p>
                        <p>I think for these people there could be extra pressure and burden on them, but for any kinds of
                          situation, I think it’s always important to have a good communication with people around you, let them
                          know what really is happening to you, and not to leave regrets till the last minute.</p>
